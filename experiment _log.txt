- i train a new model with two prefixes for channel only and channel+function generation mode
- the name of the model is rob2rand_chen_w_prefix_26-5-22


30-5-2022
- i evaluate the model that i trained on 26-5-2022, and:
    - the result for function-level generation is similar to the original one (without prefix)
    - the result for channel-level is quite high and satisfying
- i uploade the model to the hub with name: rob2rand_chen_w_prefix_c_fc (https://huggingface.co/imamnurby/rob2rand_chen_w_prefix_c_fc)

2-6-2022
- i create a new dataset comprised of mi + chen
- i remove samples that do not have channel/function descriptions in the new dataset
- i do not remove the intersection from both mi and chen (unlike in icpc paper, i remove them). i think more data is better as long as there is no data leakage
- the dataset can be found in dataset-original folder
- metadata.csv contains the description for each channel and function
- original.csv contains the original dataset that has been concatenated
- processed.csv contains pairs of source and target
- i train a new model using training_merged_new.ipynb and the model name is rob2rand_merged_w_prefix_c_fc
